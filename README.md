# Active Jet Spoiler – Experimental Fluid Mechanics Study

This repository contains the physical and digital work for an experimental study on using an **air jet over a rear spoiler** to modify the aerodynamic drag (and potentially downforce) of a simplified car model.

The project combines:
- Hardware design and experimental rig build,
- Fluid mechanics analysis and calculations, and
- Data processing and visualisation scripts.

## 1. Motivation

Automotive aerodynamics is usually a trade-off between:
- Reducing **drag** (better fuel efficiency / range), and  
- Increasing **downforce** (better grip and stability).

This project explores whether an **active surface jet** over a rear spoiler can:
- Delay separation / modify the flow,
- Change pressure distribution over the spoiler and rear of the car, and
- Ultimately reduce drag (or at least tune it) at given operating conditions.

## 2. Project Objectives

**Primary objective**

> To experimentally investigate the effect of a surface jet over a rear spoiler on the drag coefficient of a simplified car model.

**Secondary objectives (optional, keep or edit)**

- Quantify changes in lift/downforce when the jet is activated.
- Compare baseline (no jet) vs. multiple jet velocities and spoiler angles.
- Compute key non-dimensional parameters (Reynolds number, jet momentum coefficient, drag coefficient).
- Provide a reproducible, well-documented workflow (data + analysis + report) for future work or extension to CFD.
